A modern, robust, and aesthetically pleasing music player for Android. This project demonstrates modern Android development practices, including foreground services for background playback, the `MediaStore` API for efficient music discovery, and a clean UI built with `RecyclerView`.

### âœ¨ Features

 - Modern & Minimalist UI: A clean, "forest green" themed interface with rounded corners and smooth transitions.

 - Background Playback: Music is managed by a Foreground Service, ensuring playback continues seamlessly when the app is in the background or the screen is off.

 - Efficient Music Discovery: Uses the modern MediaStore API to quickly find all .mp3 and .wav files on the device without bogging down the system.

 - Robust Player Controls: Full control with Play/Pause, Next, Previous, and a scrubbable SeekBar.

 - Audio Visualizer: A simple, custom-built bar visualizer that syncs with the currently playing audio.
